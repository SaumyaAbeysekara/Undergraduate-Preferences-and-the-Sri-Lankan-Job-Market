# ANALYZING THE  IMPACT OF  UNDERGRADUATE PREFERENCES  ON THE SRI LANKAN  JOB MARKET


## Introduction
  
Sri Lanka faces financial instability, prompting emigration and exacerbating unemployment. Understanding how undergraduates' choices impact the job market is vital. This analysis aims to identify factors influencing their decisions to enhance Sri Lanka's employment landscape.

## Significance of the study


We want to discover what motivates young Sri Lankans to move or search for opportunities abroad, that's why our study is essential. By determining these causes, we may discover the difficulties the Sri Lankan job market faces and explore possible solutions.
